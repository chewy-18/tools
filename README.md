# tools

Just some security tools that I've found useful along the way. 

* pattern_of_life.py - takes a series of datetimes, histograms, and converts to specified timezone 
* evtx2json.py - takes a file or directory of evtx files and converts to json with possible enrichments 
* ps_output_files.py - takes the PS operational json output from evtx2json.py and writes out ps1 into separate files
* json_views/ps_4104.sh - takes the PS operational json output from evtx2json.py and shows code blocks in flat form
